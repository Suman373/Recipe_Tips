## How to Use? 

- The signup page doesn't have authentication so click the signup button (with or without putting in the details)
- You can click the login account too, in case you wanna check it out!
- Either way, you will reach the main/home page, which contains the recipes(limited for now), no APIs have been used due to subscription problems.
